    <h1>Prey Facts</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>Penguins primarily feed on fish, krill, and squid, which they catch by diving deep into the ocean.</li>
      <li>Some species of penguins, such as the chinstrap penguin, feed primarily on krill, which is a small crustacean that is a key component of the Antarctic food web.</li>
      <li>Ad√©lie penguins are known for their ability to dive deep and travel long distances in search of food, sometimes swimming over 185 miles in a single trip.</li>
      <li>Changes in the availability of prey due to climate change, overfishing, and other factors can have significant impacts on penguin populations.</li>
      <li>Conservation efforts to protect prey species can indirectly benefit penguins and other species that rely on these important food sources.</li>
