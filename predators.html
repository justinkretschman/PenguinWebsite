    <h1>Predators Facts</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>Leopard seals are the main predator of penguins in Antarctica, preying on several different species of penguins.</li>
      <li>Killer whales are also a significant predator of penguins, particularly in areas where penguins are abundant.</li>
      <li>Skuas, a type of seabird, are known to prey on penguin chicks and eggs.</li>
      <li>Introduced predators, such as rats and cats, have also had a devastating impact on some penguin populations by preying on eggs and chicks and destroying breeding colonies.</li>
      <li>Penguins have adapted several strategies to avoid predation, such as breeding in large colonies to reduce the risk of individual predation and using agility and speed to evade predators in the water.</li>
      <li>Conservation efforts to protect penguins and their habitats can also indirectly benefit predator species by preserving the delicate balance of the ecosystem.</li>
